# ShAKti Lexer 
      ~ Sanskrit-Inspired Lexical Analyzer

## 🔥 Introduction
The **ShAKti Lexer** is a fundamental component of the ShAKti programming language, responsible for breaking down the Sanskrit-inspired code into meaningful tokens. Developed in **C**, it ensures an efficient and accurate interpretation of the ShAKti syntax.

## 🔧 Features
✅ **Recognizes Sanskrit Keywords** – Identifies ShAKti-specific reserved words.<br>
✅ **Efficient Tokenization** – Optimized for speed and memory management.<br>
✅ **Handles Comments & Whitespace** – Ensures smooth processing.<br>

---

## 📜 How It Works
1. Reads the source code as input.
2. Identifies tokens such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.
3. Ignores whitespace and comments.
4. Generates a stream of tokens to be processed by the **ShAKti Parser**.

## 💻 Example Code (Lexer in Action)
```shakti
पूर्ण संख्या = 10;
यदि (संख्या > 5) {
    लेख("संख्या बड़ी है");
}
```
The lexer breaks this into tokens:
```
[पूर्ण] [संख्या] [=] [10] [;]
[यदि] [(] [संख्या] [>] [5] [)] [{]
[लेख] [(] ["संख्या बड़ी है"] [)] [;]
[}]
```
