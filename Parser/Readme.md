# ShAKti Parser 
        ~ Sanskrit-Inspired Syntax Analyzer

## 🔥 Introduction
The **ShAKti Parser** is responsible for analyzing the structure of Sanskrit-inspired ShAKti code and ensuring its correctness based on predefined syntax rules. Written in **C**, it processes tokens generated by the **ShAKti Lexer** and constructs a meaningful syntax tree for execution.

---

## 🚀 Why ShAKti Parser?
- 🎯 **Ensures Syntax Accuracy** – Checks the proper usage of Sanskrit-based syntax.
- ⚡ **Optimized for Performance** – Fast and efficient parsing with minimal overhead.
- 🏗️ **Custom Built from Scratch** – Designed exclusively for ShAKti’s unique language structure.
- 🔄 **Error Detection** – Identifies syntax errors and provides meaningful feedback.

## 🔧 Features
✅ **Syntax Tree Generation** – Transforms token streams into structured syntax.<br>
✅ **Handles Complex Expressions** – Supports nested and multi-level expressions.<br>
✅ **Error Reporting** – Pinpoints syntax issues for debugging.<br>
✅ **Efficient Memory Management** – Optimized to handle large codebases.<br>

---

## 📜 How It Works
1. Accepts tokens from the **ShAKti Lexer**.
2. Validates token sequences according to the ShAKti grammar.
3. Constructs an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** for execution.
4. Reports syntax errors with precise debugging information.

## 💻 Example Code (Parsing in Action)
```shakti
पूर्ण संख्या = 10;
यदि (संख्या > 5) {
    लेख("संख्या बड़ी है");
}
```
The parser checks the syntax and constructs an **AST**:
```
Program
├── VariableDeclaration(पूर्ण संख्या = 10)
├── IfStatement
│   ├── Condition(संख्या > 5)
│   ├── Block
│       ├── PrintStatement("संख्या बड़ी है")
```
